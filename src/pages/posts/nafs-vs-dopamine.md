**TL;DR:** Track triggers → Insert a Sunnah micro-action → Reward the right behavior — repeat.

**Protocol (5 mins a day):**
1. Identify your top trigger (time, place, emotion).
2. Pre-decide a *dhikr-based* interrupt (e.g., say *astaghfirullah* + 10 deep breaths).
3. Replace the loop: Stimulus → Sunnah action → Small halal reward (tea, short walk).
4. Weekly review: what got easier? what still spikes dopamine?
