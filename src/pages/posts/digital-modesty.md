**Detox plan (7 days):**
- Day 1–2: Move apps off home screen; grayscale phone after Isha.
- Day 3–4: Replace morning scroll with Qur’an 10 mins + walk.
- Day 5–7: 2-hour windowed social use; post only, no explore.

**Why it works:** reduces novelty spikes, increases baseline contentment (*qana‘ah*).
