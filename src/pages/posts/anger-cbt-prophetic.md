**When anger hits:**
- Say *a‘udhu billah*, stay silent for 60 seconds.
- Change state: sit if standing, lie if sitting, make wudu.
- Cognitive check: What thought is fueling this? Label it. Replace with a just thought.
- Leave the scene; return only when heart rate normalizes.

Prophetic advice + CBT basics = reliable control.
